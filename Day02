Controlling the Node.js Process
Want to quit your running Node.js server?

You can always do that by pressing CTRL + C in the terminal/ command prompt window where you started your server (i.e. where you ran node app.js).

Headers are metadata, meta information added to a requestand also to response....

res.write --> allows us to write a data to the response

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers(read about headers)

req.on() --> on method allows us to listen certain events

event loop in nodejs??

nodejs uses only single javascript thread  
a thread is bascically like a process in our operating system
